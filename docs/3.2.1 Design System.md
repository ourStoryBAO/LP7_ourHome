## Foundations
### Introductions
- Design systems are more than UI Kits
- Design systems need end to end communication with brand team, developers, contractors, entire team
- This design system will not be complete. It's an evolving document. Stay tuned as it updates
- This tutorial teaches the fundamental components that get us to the final product, but not every single step
- The system we create will be available for free within the [Figma community](https://www.figma.com/community)
- Our design system is just one perspective

- Typescales are the rhythm of how the different sized fonts relate to one another throughout your project.
