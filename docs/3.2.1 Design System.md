### 0.7.0 PURPOSE DEFINITION
- Design systems are more than UI Kits
- Design systems need end to end communication with brand team, developers, contractors, entire team
- This design system will not be complete. It's an evolving document. Stay tuned as it updates
- This tutorial teaches the fundamental components that get us to the final product, but not every single step
- The system we create will be available for free within the [Figma community](https://www.figma.com/community)
- Our design system is just one perspective

### 1.0.0 INITIATE MISSION

### 2.1.0 GROUND OPERATIONS

### 3.2.0 INTEND DESIGN
#### 3.2.1 Design System
> Everything starts with type and then moves out from there
#### Typescales
- Typescales are a series of font sizes that include typography, font size, line height, etc.
- Typescales are the rhythm of how the different sized fonts relate to one another throughout your project.
- Typographic scale can be learned about [here](https://spencermortensen.com/articles/typographic-scale/)
- We will use the golden ratio typographic scale
- Put 1.618 into the document for quick reference
- We chose 18pt as the body scale since 1 + 8 = 9
- Copy and paste the 18pt bod font and multiply it by 1.618 -> (18 * 1.618) = 29.12 ~ 30
- Copy and paste the 18pt body font and multiply it by 1.618 twice -> (29.12 * 1.618) = 47.12 ~ 48
- Copy and paste the 18pt body font and multiply it by 1.618 twice -> (47.12 * 1.618) = 76.24 ~ 78
- We also want a small text, so we divide 18 by 1.618 -> (18 / 1.618) = 11.12 ~ 15 (11 is pretty small)
- For each of these, we rounded to the nearest number that's divisible by 3 (Tesla nerd)

> We're creating a design system, so we're only designing what we need. This is digital product design. This is for an app.

#### Create notes of everything we'll need
- Title/h1, h2, h3, body copy, small fonts
- Subtitle, Stonrg/bold, Em/emphasized, button text, pre title
- Save text styles to everything we used

#### Line height
- Body copy line height needs to be increased so its readable

#### Colors
- Used the Bitcoin.design colors as the basis
- Extended them so the 7 chakras colors can serve as the initial brand colors or ourStory
